# Disclaimer  : 
#      While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and validity of parameters provided below
#      the assignment of parameters is being based on an automated procedure combining data provided by a
#      given user as well as calculations performed using third party software. They are provided as a guide.
#      The authors of the ATB cannot guarantee that the parameters are complete or that the parameters provided
#      are appropriate for use in any specific application. Users are advised to treat these parameters with discretion
#      and to perform additional validation tests for their specific application if required. Neither the authors
#      of the ATB or The University of Queensland except any responsibly for how the parameters may be used.
#
# Release notes and warnings: 
#  (1) The topology is based on a set of atomic coordinates and other data provided by the user after
#      after quantum mechanical optimization of the structure using different levels of theory depending on
#      the nature of the molecule.
#  (2) In some cases the automatic bond, bond angle and dihedral type assignment is ambiguous.
#      In these cases alternative type codes are provided at the end of the line.
#  (3) While bonded parameters are taken where possible from the nominated force field non-standard bond, angle and dihedral
#      type code may be incorporated in cases where an exact match could not be found. These are marked as "non-standard"
#      or "uncertain" in comments.
#  (4) In some cases it is not possible to assign an appropriate parameter automatically. "%" is used as a place holder
#      for those fields that could not be determined automatically. The parameters in these fields must be assigned manually
#      before the file can be used.

# Final Topology Generation was performed using: 
# A B3LYP/6-31G* optimized geometry.
# Bonded and van der Waals parameters were taken from the GROMOS 54A7 parameter set.
# Initial charges were estimated using the ESP method of Merz-Kollman.
# Final charges and charge groups were generated by method described in the ATB paper.
# If required, additional bonded parameters were generated from a Hessian matrix calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.
